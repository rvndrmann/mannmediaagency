# MCP Implementation Plan

## 1. MCP Architecture Overview

*   **Purpose:** MCP facilitates communication between the application and external tools/models.
*   **Key Components:**
    *   `MCPContext`: Manages the connection status and provides access to MCP tools.
    *   `MCPServerService`: Handles communication with the MCP server.
    *   `useMCPContext`: Hook for accessing the MCP context.
    *   `useMcpTool`: Hook for executing MCP tools.
*   **Context Provision:** The MCP context is provided to the Canvas and MultiAgentChat components using the `MCPProvider`.

## 2. MCP Implementation in Canvas

*   **Features:**
    *   Scene generation (script, description, image prompt, image, video).
    *   Tool execution.
*   **`useCanvasAgentMCP` Hook:** The `useCanvasAgent` hook utilizes the `useCanvasAgentMCP` hook to integrate with MCP.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Modify the `generateSceneScript`, `generateSceneDescription`, `generateImagePrompt`, `generateSceneImage`, and `generateSceneVideo` functions in `useCanvasAgentMCP.ts` to call the appropriate MCP tools.
    *   Pass the necessary parameters to the MCP tools, such as the scene ID and any relevant context.
    *   Update the scene with the results returned by the MCP tools.

## 3. MCP Implementation in MultiAgentChat

*   **Features:**
    *   Managing the connection status.
    *   Reconnecting to the MCP server.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Implement a mechanism to receive updates from the MCP server when video creation is complete or text prompts are generated.
    *   Update the chat interface with the results received from the MCP server.
    *   Consider using WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) to receive real-time updates from the MCP server.

## 4. MCP Tool Definitions

*   The MCP tools are defined in the `src/services/mcpService.ts` file.
*   Each tool has a specific purpose and accepts certain parameters.

## 5. Supabase Functions

*   The `supabase/functions/mcp-server/index.ts` file implements an MCP server.
*   The Supabase function handles requests from the application and interacts with external tools/models.
