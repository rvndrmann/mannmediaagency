# Rap Song Scene Prompts: Anime Warrior Style

Based on the lyrics provided and inspired by the Berserk anime style.

## Intro (0-5 seconds - Beats)

**Image Prompt:**
Dynamic anime splash screen, dark fantasy aesthetic, featuring the song title or artist name in a gritty, metallic, blood-splattered font. Background shows storm clouds gathering over a desolate, craggy battlefield under a blood-red moon. Style of Kentaro Miura's Berserk manga art.

**Video Description:**
*   **Subject Movement:** None (static image or title card).
*   **Camera Movement:** Slow, ominous zoom in on the title/central element, or alternatively, quick, jarring cuts between stylized elements (like close-ups of cracked armor, a sword hilt, a glaring eye) synchronized with the beat.

## Scene 1: Resilience (Lyrics: "Changa madda time Hoya / Meh majabur nai")

**Image Prompt:**
Anime warrior resembling Guts from Berserk, standing defiantly on a windswept cliff edge under a dark, turbulent sky. Clad in heavy, scarred black armor, gripping a massive, chipped greatsword planted firmly in the rocky ground beside him. His expression is grim and determined, facing into the wind. Dramatic, low-angle shot emphasizing his solitary strength against the elements. Style of Berserk (1997 anime).

**Video Description:**
*   **Subject Movement:** Warrior remains mostly still, a bulwark against the wind. His tattered cape whips violently. A slight, deliberate clench of the gauntleted fist holding the sword hilt.
*   **Camera Movement:** Slow dolly zoom moving upwards from the base of the sword towards the warrior's determined face, emphasizing his imposing figure and resolve against the harsh environment.

## Scene 2: Defiance (Lyrics: "Maut manjur manu / Har majur nai")

**Image Prompt:**
Intense close-up anime shot focusing on the warrior's face. Eyes burning with fierce defiance, staring directly at the viewer. Fresh and old scars are visible on his weathered face. Rain or sweat streaks down his face, mixing with grime. Dark, high-contrast chiaroscuro lighting highlighting the sharp angles of his features and the intensity in his eyes. Background is completely blurred or dark. Berserk anime style (Memorial Edition).

**Video Description:**
*   **Subject Movement:** Minimal physical movement. A slight narrowing of the eyes into a glare, a subtle tightening of the jaw, perhaps a bead of sweat tracing a path down his temple.
*   **Camera Movement:** Extreme close-up, holding steady on the eyes. A very slow, almost imperceptible push-in to heighten the tension and focus on his unwavering gaze.

## Scene 3: Vulnerability/Offering (Lyrics: "Aa leya meda jodeya sera dil majbor c")

**Image Prompt:**
Anime warrior, posture slightly less guarded, perhaps kneeling or slightly hunched. He holds out a crudely stitched-together, faintly glowing heart object in his heavily gauntleted hand. The armor looks burdensome. His expression is a complex mix of past pain, weariness, and grim acceptance. Set in a dimly lit, enclosed space like a cave mouth or ruined stone structure. Focus is sharp on the offered heart, background slightly softer. Style reminiscent of dark fantasy anime visuals.

**Video Description:**
*   **Subject Movement:** Slow, deliberate, almost reluctant extension of the hand offering the heart. Head might be slightly bowed, eyes looking down at the offering or closed briefly.
*   **Camera Movement:** Medium shot initially showing the warrior's posture, then slowly racking focus from his face (showing the emotion) to the detailed, glowing heart in his hand.

## Scene 4: Renewed Defiance (Lyrics: "Maut manjur manu / Har majur nai")

**Image Prompt:**
Dynamic, low-angle anime action pose. The warrior, resembling Guts in his Berserker armor (if applicable, otherwise standard armor), is captured mid-swing with his colossal sword, creating a powerful arc of motion blur. Sparks fly violently as the sword impacts unseen resistance or scrapes heavily against stone ground. Musculature is tense, expression is a ferocious snarl. Dark, gritty, high-energy Berserk manga panel style.

**Video Description:**
*   **Subject Movement:** Explosive, brutally fast movement. The warrior pivots, putting his whole body into the massive sword swing. A guttural yell might be implied.
*   **Camera Movement:** Rapid whip pan following the trajectory of the sword's arc. Could incorporate a slight impact shake effect as the sword connects or hits the ground, emphasizing the raw power.

## Scene 5: Rejection (Lyrics: "Hasss ke na bola menu / Tu Meri hoor nai")

**Image Prompt:**
Anime warrior resolutely turning his back and walking away into deep shadow or swirling mist. His silhouette is stark against a dimly lit background. Behind him, a faint, almost translucent, beautiful ethereal female figure (the 'hoor') might be visible, reaching out with a sorrowful expression, but she is out of focus or beginning to dissipate. The warrior's posture is dismissive, shoulders set. Moody, atmospheric lighting. Dark fantasy anime aesthetic, emphasizing loneliness and finality.

**Video Description:**
*   **Subject Movement:** Warrior walks steadily away from the camera, back fully turned, without hesitation. He disappears into the darkness/mist. The ethereal figure behind might reach out, then slowly fade or dissolve completely.
*   **Camera Movement:** Static shot, possibly framed from slightly behind the ethereal figure's perspective, watching the warrior depart. A slow zoom out could emphasize the growing distance and isolation.
