# Product Requirements Document: Canvas Page Testing

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for testing the Canvas page (http://localhost:8081/canvas) using Playwright MCP. The goal is to ensure the functionality, output quality (video and image), and performance of the Canvas page.

## 2. Goals

*   Automate testing of the Canvas page using Playwright MCP.
*   Verify the quality of generated scene images and videos.
*   Validate the accuracy of generated scripts and voiceover text.
*   Identify areas for performance improvement.

## 3. Functionality to be Tested

*   **Scene Image Generation:**
    *   Verify that scene images are generated correctly based on user input.
    *   Test different input parameters and their impact on image quality.
    *   Check for errors or inconsistencies in generated images.
*   **Scene Video Generation:**
    *   Verify that scene videos are generated correctly from scene images and scripts.
    *   Test different video generation parameters (e.g., resolution, frame rate).
    *   Check for errors or inconsistencies in generated videos.
*   **Script Generation:**
    *   Verify that scripts are generated accurately based on user input.
    *   Test different script generation parameters (e.g., length, style).
    *   Check for grammatical errors or inconsistencies in generated scripts.
*   **Voiceover Text Generation:**
    *   Verify that voiceover text is generated correctly from scripts.
    *   Test different voiceover generation parameters (e.g., voice, speed).
    *   Check for errors or inconsistencies in generated voiceover text.
*   **Automation and Generation Buttons:**
    *   Verify that all automation and generation buttons function as expected.
    *   Test the integration between different components of the Canvas page.

## 4. Playwright MCP Tests

The following Playwright MCP tests should be implemented:

*   **Image Generation Test:**
    *   Navigate to the Canvas page.
    *   Input specific parameters for scene image generation.
    *   Click the "Generate Image" button.
    *   Verify that an image is generated and displayed correctly.
    *   Take a screenshot of the generated image for comparison.
*   **Video Generation Test:**
    *   Navigate to the Canvas page.
    *   Input specific parameters for scene video generation.
    *   Click the "Generate Video" button.
    *   Verify that a video is generated and played correctly.
    *   Capture the video output for analysis.
*   **Script Generation Test:**
    *   Navigate to the Canvas page.
    *   Input specific parameters for script generation.
    *   Click the "Generate Script" button.
    *   Verify that a script is generated and displayed correctly.
    *   Save the generated script for analysis.
*   **Voiceover Generation Test:**
    *   Navigate to the Canvas page.
    *   Input a generated script.
    *   Click the "Generate Voiceover" button.
    *   Verify that voiceover text is generated and played correctly.
    *   Capture the voiceover output for analysis.
*   **Performance Test:**
    *   Measure the time taken to generate scene images and videos.
    *   Identify bottlenecks and areas for optimization.

## 5. Performance Goals

*   Scene image generation time: Less than 5 seconds.
*   Scene video generation time: Less than 15 seconds.
*   Script generation time: Less than 2 seconds.
*   Voiceover generation time: Less than 3 seconds.

## 6. Areas for Improvement

*   Optimize image and video generation algorithms.
*   Implement caching mechanisms to reduce generation time.
*   Improve the user interface for better usability.

## 7. Test Environment

*   Local URL: http://localhost:8081/canvas
*   Playwright MCP
*   Node.js 14.0.0 or higher
