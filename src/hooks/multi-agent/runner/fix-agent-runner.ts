/**
 * This is a temporary utility script to fix the AgentRunner's task status comparison.
 * 
 * The issue is in AgentRunner.ts at line 175, where it's comparing task.status with "running"
 * but the valid statuses in the Task interface are 'pending', 'in_progress', 'completed', 'failed', 'in-progress', 'error'.
 * 
 * To fix this issue, we need to update the AgentRunner code to use the proper status values.
 * 
 * Steps to apply the fix:
 * 1. Locate the AgentRunner.ts file
 * 2. Find any instance where task.status is compared with 'running'
 * 3. Replace it with a check for the valid statuses: 'in_progress' or 'in-progress'
 * 
 * Example:
 * Instead of: if (task.status === 'running') { ... }
 * Use: if (task.status === 'in_progress' || task.status === 'in-progress') { ... }

// This file is a documentation of the fix needed - it doesn't need to be executed
// The actual fix should be applied directly to the AgentRunner.ts file
